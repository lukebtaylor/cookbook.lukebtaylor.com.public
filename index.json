[{"categories":null,"contents":"Ingredients Ingredient Subheading 1/2 recipe Buttery, Flaky Pie Dough or store-bought dough (see note) 1/2 cup granulated sugar (4 ounces; 113g) 6 tablespoons white balsamic vinegar (3 ounces; 90ml), divided 2 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 ounce; 28g) 1 tablespoon (15ml) Dijon mustard 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves, plus more for garnish 1 1/2 teaspoons (5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or the same weight 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 small green cabbage head (2 to 3 pounds; 908 to1.3kg), cut into 1-inch wedges with core intact 1 tablespoon (14g) unsalted butter, softened 2 ounces (56g) Gruyère cheese, shredded (1/2 cup) Directions Prepare Buttery, Flaky Pie Dough according to the recipe. After rolling, folding, and dividing dough in half, roll one portion into a 10-inch round, 1/8-to 1/4-inch thick. (Save the other half for another use.) Transfer to a large, flat plate lined with parchment, or another similar arrangement. Working around circumference, fold 1/2 inch of dough over itself and pinch to create 9-inch round with raised rim. Cut three 2-inch slits in center of dough, and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Place sugar and 2 tablespoons (30ml) of the vinegar in a 10-inch oven-safe stainless-steel skillet; heat over low, undisturbed, swirling and tilting pan occasionally, until mixture is light golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Increase heat to medium-low; swirl in butter, Dijon, thyme, salt, black pepper, and remaining 4 tablespoons (60ml) vinegar; cook, stirring often, until thick and deep golden, 7 to 9 minutes. Remove from heat, pour in even layer into bottom of a 13-by 9-inch baking dish; clean and dry skillet. Place cabbage wedges in baking dish, overlapping as needed. (They won’t fit in an even layer, but will shrink as they cook). Bake, gently turning wedges every 20 minutes, until very tender and golden brown, about 1 hour. Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Using a slotted spoon or slotted fish spatula, transfer cabbage to the prepared baking sheet, arranging wedges in an even layer, and allow drain. Discard remaining liquids from baking dish. Using clean paper towels, firmly press cabbage wedges to soak up any excess moisture. Grease cleaned skillet with softened butter; arrange roasted cabbage wedges tightly in an even layer in rose pattern: Beginning in center of skillet, place small leaves/bits, slightly overlapping as needed; working out towards sides of pan, place cabbage wedges with narrow edge facing toward center, overlapping as needed until all wedges are used. Sprinkle evenly with Gruyère. Carefully place pastry, rim side down, over cabbage, making sure it is centered and not touching skillet sides. Bake at 400°F until crust is golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer skillet to wire rack set; let cool for 5 minutes. Run a sharp knife or small offset around edges to loosen; place a plate over skillet, carefully invert tarte tatin onto plate. Garnish with additional thyme; slice and serve immediately. Make-Ahead and Storage You can use 1/2 (14.1 oz.) package refrigerated pie dough, at room temperature, in place of homemade pie dough or 1 sheet frozen all-butter puff pastry, thawed.\nReference https://youtu.be/XoRsDZEePRc?si=orTA3PqtbqxTzhg0 https://www.seriouseats.com/savory-cabbage-tart-tatine-recipe-8646214 ","imageLink":null,"permalink":"https://cookbook.lukebtaylor.com/cabbage-tarte-tatin/","tags":["cabbage"],"title":"Cabbage Tarte Tatin"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Ingredients 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil 3 cloves garlic, minced 1/2 cup onion, diced 5 green onions, sliced on a bias (white and green parts) 1 pound ground pork 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger sea salt and black pepper, to taste 1 tablespoon Sriracha or garlic chili sauce, more to taste 14 ounce bag coleslaw mix (green cabbage, red cabbage and carrots) 3 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon unseasoned rice vinegar 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds Directions Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.

Stir in flour and cook until mixture begins to turn a light golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Pour in chicken broth, and stir constantly until mixture thickens. Add cream, ham, rosemary, freshly ground black pepper, and cayenne. Stir in a splash of water, and bring mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in peas, taste, and adjust seasoning. Remove from heat and let cool. Refrigerate until needed. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with foil. Stir salt into flour in a bowl, and make a well in the center. Bring butter and water to a simmer, and as soon as butter is almost all melted, remove from heat and carefully pour into the flour. Stir until mixture starts to come together, and is cool enough to handle. Press dough together in the bowl, and transfer to a work surface. Press and knead briefly to form a ball of dough, then shape into a disc. At any point if the dough is too dry, sprinkle over some cold water to adjust the texture. Flour both sides of dough, and roll into a circle about 1/8-inch thick. Cut into 4 pieces; you will work with 1 piece at a time. Place remaining dough pieces on a plate, and cover until ready to use. Cut a circle slightly larger than the size of the ramekin you are using from 1 piece of dough; set aside. Gather up the rest of the piece of dough into a ball; press into a disc. Again, roll out 1/8-inch thick, and place into the ramekin. Press firmly into the bottom and sides of the ramekin, trying to maintain an even thickness, and make sure the dough extends up and over the top edge. Fill to the top with cooled ham mixture. Whisk egg and the 1 teaspoon water together in a small bowl to make egg wash. Brush egg wash around top edge of dough in the ramekin. Lightly brush the round top piece with egg wash, and center dough, egg-wash-side down, over the filling. Press to seal edges of top and bottom crust together. Trim crust to the edge of the ramekin with a knife. For a decorative crimp, press the tines of a fork around the crust edges; this will also help to seal edges firmly. Brush top crust with egg wash. Make a hole in the center with the tip of a knife to vent steam. Repeat the process to make 3 more pies with remaining dough and filling. Transfer finished pot pies to the prepared sheet pan. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, and the sauce is bubbling out of the hole in the center, about 1 hour. Serve hot, eaten with a spoon from the ramekin, or let cool to warm, and remove whole pot pie from ramekin, to eat with your hands. These are also great eaten at room temperature or cold.

Let the yeast and water sit at room temperature for 15 minutes, until the mixture has bubbled and expanded. If you\u0026rsquo;re using instant yeast, you can skip this step. Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Combine the dissolved yeast (or the instant yeast) with the remainder of the ingredients. Mix and knead everything together —by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle — till you\u0026rsquo;ve made a soft, smooth dough. If you\u0026rsquo;re kneading in a stand mixer, it should take 4 to 5 minutes at second speed, and the dough should barely clean the sides of the bowl, perhaps sticking a bit at the bottom. Don\u0026rsquo;t over-knead the dough; it should hold together, but can still look fairly rough on the surface. To make pizza up to 24 hours later, skip to step 5. To make pizza now: Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl, and allow it to rise till it\u0026rsquo;s very puffy. This will take about an hour using instant yeast, or 90 minutes using active dry. If it takes longer, that\u0026rsquo;s OK; just give it some extra time. Take it a step further The best thin-crust pizza via @kingarthurflour BLOG The best thin-crust pizza BY PJ HAMEL To make pizza later: Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 45 minutes at room temperature. Refrigerate the dough for 4 hours (or for up to 24 hours); it will rise slowly as it chills. This step allows you more schedule flexibility; it also develops the crust\u0026rsquo;s flavor. About 2 to 3 hours before you want to serve pizza, remove the dough from the refrigerator. Decide what size, shape, and thickness of pizza you want to make. This recipe will make one of the following choices: Two 1/2\u0026quot;-thick 14\u0026quot; round pizzas (pictured); Two 3/4\u0026quot;-thick 12\u0026quot; round pizzas; One 3/4\u0026quot; to 1\u0026quot;-thick 13\u0026quot; x 18\u0026quot; rectangular (Sicilian-style) pizza (pictured); One 1 1/2\u0026quot;-thick 9\u0026quot; x 13\u0026quot; rectangular pizza; One 1\u0026quot;-thick 14\u0026quot; round pizza. Divide the dough in half, for two pizzas; or leave it whole for one pizza. If you\u0026rsquo;re making a rectangular pizza, shape the dough into a rough oval. For a round pizza, shape it into a rough circle. In either case, don\u0026rsquo;t pat it flat; just stretch it briefly into shape. Allow the dough to rest, covered with an overturned bowl or lightly greased plastic wrap, for 15 minutes. Use vegetable oil pan spray to lightly grease the pan(s) of your choice. Drizzle olive oil into the bottom of the pan(s). The pan spray keeps the pizza from sticking; the olive oil gives the crust great flavor and crunch. Place the dough in the prepared pan(s). Press it over the bottom of the pan, stretching it towards the edges. You\u0026rsquo;ll probably get about two-thirds of the way there before the dough starts shrinking back; walk away for 15 minutes. Cover the dough while you\u0026rsquo;re away, so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t dry out. When you come back, you should be able to pat the dough closer to the corners of the pan. Repeat the rest and dough-stretch one more time, if necessary; your goal is to get the dough to fill the pan as fully as possible. Allow the dough to rise, covered, till it\u0026rsquo;s noticeably puffy, about 90 minutes (if it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been refrigerated); or 2 to 2 1/2 hours (if it\u0026rsquo;s been refrigerated). Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 450°F. Bake the pizza on the lower oven rack till it looks and feels set on top, and is just beginning to brown around the edge of the crust, but is still pale on top. This will take about 8 minutes for thinner crust pizza; about 10 to 12 minutes for medium thickness; and 12 to 14 minutes for thick-crust pizza. If you\u0026rsquo;re baking two pizzas, reverse them in the oven (top to bottom, bottom to top) midway through the baking period. To serve pizza immediately: Remove it from the oven, and arrange your toppings of choice on top. Return to the oven, and bake on the upper oven rack for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until the crust is nicely browned, both top and bottom, and the cheese is melted. Check it midway through, and move it to the bottom rack if the top is browning too much, or the bottom not enough. To serve pizza up to 2 days later: Remove the untopped, partially baked crust from the oven, cool completely on a rack, wrap in plastic, and store at room temperature. When ready to serve, top and bake in a preheated 450°F oven, adding a couple of minutes to the baking times noted above. Your goal is a pizza whose crust is browned, and whose toppings are hot/melted. Remove the pizza from the oven, and transfer it from the pan to a rack to cool slightly before serving. For easiest serving, cut with a pair of scissors. Tips To freeze partially baked pizza crust: Bake crust as directed in step 13. Remove from the oven, cool to room temperature, wrap well, and freeze for up to 3 months. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to serve pizza, remove the crust from the freezer, and allow it to thaw, loosely wrapped, at room temperature. Once it\u0026rsquo;s completely thawed, complete pizza by starting at step 15 above. To add flexibility to your schedule, let the dough rise once at room temperature, gently deflate it, then cover and put in the fridge overnight. Next day, remove the dough from the fridge and stretch it into its pan. Let it rest and warm up until slightly puffy, then proceed with the recipe as written. If you like pizza with a deep golden brown, crispy crust, bake on a baking stone. Preheat the stone in the middle of the oven for 45 to 60 minutes. Shape and top your pizza on parchment paper or a baker\u0026rsquo;s peel and when you\u0026rsquo;re ready to bake, slide the pizza onto the hot stone (parchment and all, if you\u0026rsquo;re using parchment).

Add the oil and 240ml of the water. Use the fingers of one hand to mix the ingredients together. Add the remaining water a little at a time until you have a soft, sticky dough and all the flour is incorporated. You may not need all the water. Oil a clean work surface. Tip the dough onto the oil and knead the dough. Continue kneading for 10 minutes. The dough will become less sticky and feel smooth and silky when ready. Put the dough into a lightly oiled bowl. Cover until the dough has doubled in size. This will take between 1 - 3 hours. Once the dough has risen, tip onto a lightly floured surface. Knock back the dough by pushing out the air with your knuckles and heels of your hand. Do this until the dough is smooth. Flatten the dough into a rectangle, with the long side facing you. Fold the long side furthest away from you into the middle of the rectangle. Fold the long side nearest to you into the middle, on top of the other fold. Turn the loaf over so the seam is on the base. Tuck the ends of the loaf under to make a rough oval shape. Gently roll the loaf back and forth to form a bloomer shape. Place the bloomer on a baking tray. Put the tray inside a clean plastic bag, making sure there is enough space between the dough and the bag so it won’t touch the plastic as it rises. Leave the loaf to prove until it doubles in size. This should take about one hour. Heat the oven to 400F (200C), gas mark 6 and place a roasting tray on the bottom shelf to heat up. Once the loaf is risen, spray with water. Dust with a handful of flour and rub all over the loaf. Score 4 diagonal slashes across the top of the loaf, 2-3cm deep. Just before baking pour 1 litre of water into the baking tray. This will create steam while the loaf is cooking and give the bread a crispy crust. Place the loaf on the middle shelf and bake for 25minutes. Lower the temperature to 350F (180c), gas mark 4 and bake for a further 15minutes. The crust should be dark and crisp and the base should sound hollow when tapped.
