Add chicken and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add onion and cook, stirring, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Mix in flour and stir until flour is well mixed in, making a roux, 2 to 3 minutes. You can add more flour if you want a thicker stew. Pour in chicken broth and scrape up browned bits from the bottom. Add carrots and celery and bring gravy to a simmer. Lower heat to medium-low and maintain a steady simmer. Add thyme leaves and simmer until gravy is slightly reduced and has thickened, about 45 minutes. Dumplings Combine cheese, egg, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Mix with a spoon until smooth. Add self-rising flour and mix until a very stiff batter forms. Raise heat to medium and bring gravy back to a steady simmer. Add green onions. Remove 1 heaping tablespoon dumpling batter at a time. Shape with the use of a second tablespoon into oval dumplings and carefully drop into the simmering liquid. You should get a total of 6 dumplings out of this recipe. Dust with cayenne pepper, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer and steam dumplings until they are puffed up and cooked through without stirring or peaking, about 15 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt if necessary. A Note on dumpling cheese If you end up with a cheese that is not very soft, that is fine. It can still be used.\nCube the cheese and add a little cream to help get a better consistency for mixing with flour. Using a food processor or an immersion blender, process the cubed cheese, cream, and spices until fairly smooth. A little chunky is fine, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be perfect, but it should be the consistency of a loose batter prior to mixing with the flour.
